    <summary>B.S.B.A. in Computer Information Systems and International Business, University of Tulsa, May 2020</summary><br>
    <p class="par">I majored in both Computer Information Systems and International Business while completing my business degree, and was recognized as the Outstanding Senior in International Business by my college. I was initially drawn to Computer Information Systems because I love numbers and data, and am very interested in how we can utilize data analysis to make rational decisions. Completing the Computer Information Systems program at TU also gave me a solid logical foundation that I have been able to apply to various coding languages and relational systems, in addition to providing me with some of the specific technical skills outlined in this resume. I added International Business to my studies to reflect some of my passions. I have always loved traveling and learning new languages, and I hope that one day I'll be able to combine my technical knowledge with my interest in other cultures. </p>

    <summary>B.A. in German, University of Tulsa, May 2020</summary><br>
    <p class="par">I started learning German when I was 12, simply because my older sister had taken the same classes in school and it seemed like a good idea. Little did I know that I would continue taking German classes for the next 10 years, and end up with a degree in it. While majoring in German helped me to become fluent in the language and gain appreciation for another culture, it also challenged me to think in different ways than I was used to with my business classes. Throughout my courses at TU I got to read literature from Uwe Timm to Franz Kafka to the Brothers Grimm, and learned a lot about analysis and creative thinking that I've since been able to apply to other areas of study.</p>

    <summary>Study Abroad, 2017-2019</summary><br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>University of Siegen, Germany</b>
        <p class="par">In the spring of 2018 I studied abroad at the University of Siegen in western Germany. I was enrolled with regular German students in a variety of German classes such as "The Political Sociology of Mexico", "Democracy and Discrimination," and "Asylum and Refugee Protection in Europe." While these topics may not have been relevant to my business degree, I received 12 hours of German Language & Culture credits during my semester and was able to solidify by abilities as a fluent speaker while learning about topics and people I would not have otherwise been exposed to.</p>
      </li><br>
      <li><b>Cape Town, South Africa</b>
        <p class="par">As a member of the Global Scholars Program at TU, I took a course titled Sustainability and Urban Development that started in Tulsa and ended with a couple of weeks in Cape Town during the summer of 2017. During this trip, we were able to learn more about the development of the city and the surrounding area through a mixture of lecutres as well as in-person tours, such as a tour of Cape Town's public transit given to us by a city planner. The course emphasized how development can be sustainable, not just in terms of the environment, but also economically and socially for a given community.</p>
      </li><br>
      <li><b>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</b>
        <p class="par">As part of a class titled Doing Business in Emerging Economies, I went on a faculty-led trip to Rio de Janeiro. There we toured companies ranging from multinational oil corporations to tech startups to local craft-based businesses, while learning about the motivation, risks, and customs behind performing business in emerging economies.</p>

  <summary>GitHub</summary><br>
  <p>I completed two learning paths through the GitHub Learning Lab. My first learning path, <a href="https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/paths/first-day-on-github">First Day on GitHub</a>, walked me through how to assign myself to issues, create branches, and create and merge pull requests. I also learned how to use Markdown to format content on GitHub, and uploaded my own project to a private repository. Through my next learning path, <a href="https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/paths/first-week-on-github">First Week on GitHub</a>, I created my own GitHub Pages site. While developing this site I also customized content by creating, reviewing, and merging pull requests. Finally, I learned more about repository settings and how to secure my workflows.</p>

  <summary>Power BI</summary><br>
    <p>My <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/data-analysis-in-power-bi">Power BI course</a> began by inputting data into Power BI and learning how to edit that data in order to make it useful for modeling. This included creating new calculated columns and measures, filtering data, and learning about how to create and manipulate new data within the application. After learning how to work with data in Power BI, I moved on to data visualizations, and created pie charts, treemaps, slicers, waterfalls, and gauges, among other formats. I also learned how to arrange these visualizations in a dashboard and how to share and publish that dashboard. In later training modules, I learned how Power BI works with other applications such as Excel, and how you can also extract data from sources such as a SQL database. Finally, I was able to modify reports and dashboards to be viewed on a mobile device.</p>
<p>During my Power BI training I also created an example dashboard using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/sample-retail-analysis">Retail Analysis</a> sample dataset from Microsoft. A video of me explaining my dashboard can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/M_BMv8Bf7pQ">here</a>. I created this dashboard using data collected from a retail business with two chains. My analyses mostly focused on sales or profit, but I also included one section focusing on business by geographic location and one section comparing newer stores to previously existing stores. <br><br>

  <summary>Linux</summary><br>
    <p>My introduction to Linux was through the <a href="https://linuxacademy.com/course/lpi-linuxessentials/">LPI Linux Essentials Certification</a> on Linux Academy. In the first few training modules I gained a general understanding of operating systems and popular Linux distributions. I also learned about open-source software and licenses, and installed RPM and DEB packages to a remote server that I connected to using SSH. The next couple of sections covered working in the command line, which included learning basic commands and general syntax. I also learned how to use man pages to find more information, and I created, moved, and deleted files in my directories. In the remaining training modules I learned about basic shell scripting and turned commands into a script, I learned more about how Linux interacts with computer hardware, and I managed security by creating users and groups and editing file permissions.</p>
    <p>Here is the certification I received for completing the course:<br><img src= "doc.png" alt="Linux Certification"></p>
    <p>After completing my Linux Essentials training, I used Ubuntu via VirtualBox to set up an Algo VPN with Digital Ocean. I also used WireGuard to activate and deactivate the VPN. The following image shows my IP address before activating the VPN, and then after. You can see that the IP address in the second image matches the IP address shown for my Digital Ocean droplet, indicating a successful VPN connection.<br><img src="vpn_proof.png"></p>

  <summary>AWS</summary><br>
    <p>My experience with AWS stems from the <a href="https://linuxacademy.com/course/aws-essentials-new/">AWS Essentials</a> course on Linux Academy. To start with, I had to set up and configure users, groups, roles, and policies in order to control access to my AWS resources. Moving forward, I created a basic Virtual Private Cloud, or VPC, which included configuring internet gateways, routing tables, network access control lists, and establishing subnets across multiple Availability Zones. In the next section I configured a Linux EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) instance, which I connected to from my Mac terminal via SSH, and I set up security rules for the instance in addition to learning how I could connect to a Windows EC2 instance using Putty. In later sections of the AWS Essentials Course I learned about Amazon Simple Storage Service, or Amazon S3, and created both public and private Amazon S3 buckets to store folders and objects in. I also worked with Amazon's Simple Notification Service, or SNS, and created a CloudWatch Events rule to send email notification if there was a state change to my EC2 instance. Towards the end of the course, I learned how you can use Amazon's Electric Load Balancer to evenly distribute traffic and I learned about Route 53, or Amazon's cloud-based DNS service. Finally, I learned about serverless computing and created a basic Lambda function to shut down an EC2 instance.</p>
    <p>Here is the certification I received for completing the course:<br><img src= "awscert.png" alt="AWS Certification"></p>
    <p>After completing the AWS Essentials training, I set up an EC2 instance on AWS and used that to run a VPN using both Algo VPN and OpenVPN, as shown below.<br>

  <summary>PowerShell</summary><br>
    <p>I worked with PowerShell through the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/powershell-5-essential-training/">PowerShell 5 Essential Training</a> course on LinkedIn. The first training segment in this course touched on the cross-over between Linux and PowerShell, and I learned how you can used commands, or cmdlets, such as "get-help" to find out more information about other commands. I also learned about cmdlet syntax and used parameters and arguments to adjust commands. In the next section I learned about using snap-ins and modules in PowerShell, and  installed modules using methods like dynamic importing. During this course I also learned how to use the pipeline to string commands together, and how you can also use the pipeline to work with CSV, XML, and HTML files. Moving forward, I learned about PowerShell objects and used cmdlets like "Get-Member" and "Sort-Object" to get and filter data. I also learned how to use the PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment to record commands through variables. Finally, I enabled PowerShell remoting to use on my machine, and learned about the scalability of PowerShell remoting.</p>

  <summary>Salesforce</summary><br>
    <p>I completed the <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/trails/force_com_admin_beginner">Admin Beginner</a> trail through Salesforce Trailhead. This trail introduced me to the Salesforce platform and how to use their architecture for development. I gained exposure to the standard objects that are built in with Salesforce, and also created custom objects with unique object relationships. I also learned how you can import data into Salesforce and export data from it. In another module I learned about the Lightning experience and created and customized Lightning apps for my organization. I also edited list views, used compact and page layouts, and created buttons, links, and quick actions. Towards the end of the course I learned how to use and customize the Salesforce mobile app. Finally, I built reports and dashboards to help visualize my organization's data.</p>
